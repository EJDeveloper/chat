Online Chat
====

An online chat that allows multiple users to talk within a private chat room.

Prerequisites
-------------

* node.js 
* socket.io


How it will work
----------------

Each 'chat room' will use a 'chat name' and a 'chat password'. If multiple users type in the same 'chat name' and 'chat password', they're in the same 'chat room' and are therefore able to chat together. This will allow multiple users to 'log in' into the same 'chat room'. Each user will, however, require a unique display username per chat room which allows other users to identify them from another user.

When?
-----

We hope to begin work very soon, and we've already made a few designs. We've still not decided on a name, so 'Online Chat' will have to do for the mean time!
